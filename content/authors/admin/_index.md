I am about to become an Assistant Professor of Computational Social Science in the [School of Humanities and Social Science at CUHK (Shenzhen)](https://hss.cuhk.edu.cn/en). I am a statistician with research interests in demography and global health.

I have been collaborating with UNICEF, specifically the [UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation](https://childmortality.org/), since 2012 on developing statistical models to estimate child and adolescent mortality disparities between sex, economic status, and place of residence. I have also been working with the [UN Population Division](https://www.un.org/development/desa/pd/) since 2013 on estimating and projecting sex ratio at birth, age-specific fertility rates, and sex-specific adult mortality rates using Bayesian approaches. Since 2024, I started to collaborate with the [WHO Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research Department](https://www.who.int/teams/sexual-and-reproductive-health-and-research-(srh)/human-reproduction-programme).

I have published in journals such as *Lancet Global Health*, *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*, and *Annals of Applied Statistics*.

Fengqing is my given name, and the closest English pronunciation is "Fung-Ching". Chao is my family name, pronounced as it is spelled.

My CV is available [here](https://www.fengqingchao.com/files/cv_CHAOFENGQING.pdf). My CUHK (Shenzhen) profile is coming soon.
